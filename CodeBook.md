Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

# Introduction of Original Data
The original data set is about experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

# Data Cleaning Processes

## the original data was modifies by

* Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Useing descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


# Descriptions of Processed Data

## Identififiers
The first two columns - subjects and activities - are Identifiers.
* subjects: the ID of the subject
* activities: the name of the activity performed by the subject when measurements were taken

## Units
* The units of acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer are standard gravity units 'g'.
* The units of angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope are radians/second.
